##Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project
#Features
  Extensive data analysis and visualization to extract insights such as average scores for media based on year, month, genre, and actors.
  Text analysis capabilities that include topic modeling with LdaMulticore from gensim and pyLDAvis.
  Utilities to adjust the number of topics for LDA analysis based on coherence graphics.
  Implementation of various machine learning models for data analysis including:
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Decision Tree
    K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest
    Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
#Requirements
  The project requires Python 3.6 or higher to run. The following libraries are also required:

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    json
    scikit-learn
    nltk
    gensim
    pyLDAvis
    calendar
  Please make sure to install these dependencies before running the Jupyter notebook.

  The project should work on major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#How to Open
  This project uses Jupyter notebooks. 
  To open the notebook, navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter by typing jupyter notebook into your terminal or command prompt. 
  Then, in the Jupyter notebook dashboard, click on the notebook file to open it.

#How to Use
  Remember to adjust the path to your data file in the appropriate section of the Jupyter notebook.

  When using the LDA topic modeling feature, ensure to set the number of topics based on the coherence graphics provided by the tool.
  
  Before using nltk functions in your project, you may need to download additional resources. Use the following command in a Jupyter cell or Python script:
    nltk.download('punkt')
